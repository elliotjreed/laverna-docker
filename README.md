# About 

From Laverna:
_Laverna is a JavaScript note-taking web application with a Markdown editor and encryption support.  It's built to be an open source alternative to Evernote._

_The application stores all your notes in your browser databases such as indexedDB or localStorage, which is good for security reasons, because only you have access to them._
